# My Advent of Code stuf
Making the messiest, longest, most inefficient python solutions ever! My aim is to finish, even if i'm really slow. It's my first year properly doing this so ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… I don't expect anyone to really learn anything from this, but i've got a friend whos just getting into this stuff and is looking at my code so its mostly (i.e when i can be bothered) nicely commented ðŸ¥°

I might try to do some of it in Rust, but i'm verrrrrrrry bad at it :).
